The “class” attributes I added to divs didn’t make sense and I couldn’t wrap my mind around using a grid based layout. Finally one day everything just clicked and the puzzle in front of me suddenly made sense. I had to completely start my project over from scratch and it was a turning point in how approached my projects. After that things just started falling into place and my website was turning into something I was actually proud to show people! It was a very enlightening experience. I feel very confident that I can create quality projects in the future. I still make mistakes and accidentally forget to do things properly, but I’m learning every day. This project was really fun to do!</p>
